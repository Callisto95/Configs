# Sunset Orange

Sunset Orange is a theme for Intellij IDE's.

**IT IS A SLIGHT MODIFICATION OF Obsidian Sunset ([Jetbrains plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23938-obsidian-sunset-theme)) ([Github repo](https://github.com/lczerniawski/ObsidianSunset-JetBrains))**

That means ≈Åukasz Czerniawski did the important initial work. By now I have changed a lot of the editor colours, though many of his still remain.

## Differences

- no italic at all
- vastly changed colours
