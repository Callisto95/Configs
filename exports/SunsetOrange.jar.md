# Sunset Orange

Sunset Orange is a theme for Intellij IDE's.

**IT IS A SLIGHT MODIFICATION OF Obsidian Sunset ([Jetbrains plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23938-obsidian-sunset-theme)) ([Github repo](https://github.com/lczerniawski/ObsidianSunset-JetBrains))**

That means ≈Åukasz Czerniawski did essentially all of the work.

The differences are:

- no italic

Things I'll do later:

- use `#FF4500` as accent colour
