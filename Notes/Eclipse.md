# Eclipse

## Eclipse Italic Highlights

I hate the italic design, so here's how to remove it:

`Java > Editor > Syntax Colouring`; then uncheck `italic`

Alternatively:
`[Project Root]/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/org.eclipse.ui.workbench.prefs`

(this seems off, I haven't used Eclipse in quite some time though)

## Array initializer: Closing Brace

It's not possible to put the closing brace on a new line, if the initializer has been wrapped. It's either always on a new line or never.
