## Temperatures

Getting temperatures is quite annoying. There is no 'package' temperature, so other sources must be used.

There are some choices:

- on-die sensor: fluctuates massively; not recommended.
- Tctl (Temperature control index, not an actual sensor): A temperature index, which like the on-die sensor fluctuates a lot. This one should be used.
- CPUTIN: sensor near the CPU on the motherboard. Lower accuracy, lower fluctuation.
