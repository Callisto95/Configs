# VSCode

## Code-OSS

My variant of using code. Since it's not a Microsoft branded release, the marketplace is severely lacking. Install both `code-marketplace` and `code-features` (both AUR) to unblock everything necessary.

### code-features

`code-features` should run with every update of VSCode, but sometimes it's not enough.

```bash
# code-features-update -s
```

to manually refresh.
