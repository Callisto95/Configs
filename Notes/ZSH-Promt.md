# ZSH Prompt

> [!NOTE]
> I have moved from Zsh to Nu.

The base for the following is [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

## Powerlevel10K

[Powerlevel10K](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) has sadly ceased development. It is nonetheless a great option, but I can't recommend it anymore.

## Oh-My-Posh

[Oh-My-Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) can do what p10k can, but with a much better config.

I recommend switching. For users coming from p10k, there are already premade themes based off of Powerlevel10K.
